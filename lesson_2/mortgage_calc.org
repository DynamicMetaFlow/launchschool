* Hints
** Figure out what format inputs need to be in, for example should the interest rate be expressed as 5 or .05, if you mean 5% interest?
** If you're working with Annual Percentage Rate (APR), you'll need to convert that to a monthly interest rate.
** Be careful about the loan duration -- are you working with months or years? Choose variable names carefully to assist in remembering.
